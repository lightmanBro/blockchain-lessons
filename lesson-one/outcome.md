🧠 WHAT THIS SIMPLE BLOCKCHAIN TEACHES YOU
✔ How hashing works

Blocks use SHA-256, just like Bitcoin.

✔ How proof-of-work works

Finding a hash with leading zeros = expensive work.

✔ How a block references the previous block

previous_hash creates the chain.

✔ How tampering is detected

If someone changes data, the hash breaks.

✔ Why blockchains are immutable

Changing 1 block requires remaking all blocks after it.
